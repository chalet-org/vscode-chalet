## Features

This extension integrates the Chalet command line application into Visual Studio Code, so that one can open project folders and build & test their applications with an easy-to-use interface. Chalet is a cross-platform JSON-based project & build tool, built primarily for C++ and C.

This extension currently requires an existing Chalet installation. The latest version can be [downloaded from here](https://www.chalet-work.space/download).
